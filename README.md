# coompiler
A Semant developed for the Compiler course, writen in Java for the Cool programming language.

## About
These are the first three component of a compiler for the Cool programming language, developed for the Compilers
course during my Master’s degree.

 - the **Lexer** folder contains a JFlex specification of the language’s tokens;
 - the **Parser** folder contains a JavaCup specification of the language’s grammar;
 - the **Semant** folder contains Java code to analyze the semantic aspect, such as the inheritance graph.

## Authors
The **Semant** module has been developed in collaboration with Demia Massaro and [Jacek Filipczuk](http://github.com/jacekfilipczuk)
